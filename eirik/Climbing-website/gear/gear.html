        <div class="bouldering-additonalInfo">Bouldering is the most minimalistic form of climbing in terms of amount of needed gear. There's a ton of variety when it comes to choosing both shoes and chalk. We suggest taking a trip to your nearest climbing or outdoor store. It's highly likely that they have a collection for you to try out and you can even ask for some tips on what type of shoe is best for you. Shoe prices can range from 40$ to way over 200$, so make sure your getting the right shoe for you. Then you have chalk. You can find block chalk which is big chunks of chalk that you crush yourself, loose chalk that is already crushed for you and liquid chalk which is a liquid that quickly dries out after being applied to the skin. That's all you need to know about gear, have a fun time bouldering!</div>
